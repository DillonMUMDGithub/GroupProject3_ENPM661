I have the program as it is running for 1,500,000 Iterations, and I have it plot all points at the end of the iterations.

It does not display them as vectors yet, so I need to add that. 
I'm not exactly sure how right my logic is in everything in terms of adding and removing from open lists.

The C2C, C2G, and visited are all stored in mtrices the size of the map
